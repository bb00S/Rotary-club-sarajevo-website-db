# Intro

This GitHub repo contains all code required and produced by me and my mentor for the development of the Rotary Club Sarajevo website. 
As part of my role as a full-stack developer at Finit Consulting, I undertook the task of creating a digital platform that embodies the essence of the Rotary organization.
Throughout the development journey, I engaged with various technologies including JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, .Net, and C#. 
Complex functionalities such as interface-to-database connection and user interface implementation were meticulously crafted to ensure a seamless user experience.

An integral aspect of this project involved database management utilizing SQL Server.  I adeptly developed and executed numerous queries and exports to maintain data integrity and facilitate accessibility. 
While adhering to the aesthetic principles of the Rotary organization, this endeavor provided a significant opportunity to showcase uniqueness and creativity within the constraints of the design. 
This report encapsulates the comprehensive journey of creating the Rotary Club Sarajevo website, highlighting the technical intricacies, creative solutions, 
and enduring impact within the Rotary community.
